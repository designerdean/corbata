# Corbata

Corbata is a base layer of rules and conventions that act as a starting point for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your own projects. I got the idea from [Simon Collison's reusable package concept](http://colly.com/comments/the_process_toolbox_part_seven_convention/). He defines a reusable package as being:

>a bumper compendium of cascading and connected CSS files, naming conventions, modules, plugins and library scripts that ensure any project led or worked on by any member(s) of a team will stay on convention, and be simpler for anyone else to step into and work with at any time.

My reusable package includes all the things I use in nearly every website I build:

## Markup & Images

- [Paul Irish's conditional markup](http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/)
- [Viewport Metatag to control layout in mobile browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag#Viewport_basics)
- [Markup prompting &lt;IE8 users to upgrade browsers or install Google Chrome Frame](http://theie7countdown.com/join-the-cause) 
- Pre-sized favicon and [Apple touch icons](http://gigaom.com/apple/how-to-create-ios-device-home-screen-icons-for-web-sites/)

## CSS / Sass / Compass (requires an installation of the prereleases of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)

- [Andy Clarke's print.css](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/code)
- [Google web fonts CSS tag](http://www.google.com/webfonts)
- [Trevor Davis' Nested Responsive Grid](http://davist11.github.com/nested-responsive-grid/)
- [Nested Media Queries](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-in-sass-using-media-queries-in-sass-32)
- [Compass imports](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/) [Reset](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/reset/), [CSS3](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/), [Typography](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/), [Utilities](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/utilities/), and [Layout](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/layout/)
- An attempt to follow Nicolas Gallagher's [idiomatic CSS guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for stylesheet organization

## JavaScript

- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) - [Google Code protocol-less reference](http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/#protocolless)
